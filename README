AI Powered V2V Safety

OVERVIEW
This project, "AI Powered V2V Safety," utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect data from three types of sensors: GPS (NEO-6MV2), Lidar (TF Luna Mini), and Radar (HLK-LD1115H). It processes this data on a PC server using a TensorFlow model to detect potential collision threats, and communicates these threats back to the vehicles using MQTT.

KEY COMPONENTS
- ESP32 Microcontroller: Manages real-time data acquisition.
- GPS Sensor (NEO-6MV2): Provides geographic location data.
- Lidar Sensor (TF Luna Mini): Measures distances using laser technology.
- Radar Sensor (HLK-LD1115H): Detects objects and measures their speeds.
- Server: Intel Core i5, ASUS VivoBook, runs the AI model.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Hardware Setup:
1. Connect all sensors to the ESP32.
2. Ensure the ESP32 module is correctly powered and operational.

Software Setup:
1. Install required Python libraries:
   pip install tensorflow keras paho-mqtt
2. Download the project repository and navigate to the project folder:
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd AI-Powered-V2V-Safety
3. Execute the server script to begin data processing:
   python server.py

MQTT Configuration:
- Broker IP: 3.25.112.140
- Port: 1883

USAGE
Start the server to process sensor data. Monitor the MQTT broker to receive updates on vehicle safety status. The system evaluates the data to detect threats and communicates this information through MQTT.

TROUBLESHOOTING
If issues arise with MQTT communication:
- Check the broker IP and port settings.
- Ensure the ESP32 is connected to the internet.
- Confirm sensor connections are secure and operational.
